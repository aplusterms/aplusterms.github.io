description: "PC Hardware Standards encompass a set of specifications and protocols that determine the compatibility and functionality of various hardware components within a computer. These standards include the Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe) for expansion cards, the Serial Advanced Technology Attachment (SATA) for connecting storage devices, and Universal Serial Bus (USB) for connecting peripherals and external devices. Understanding these standards is crucial for troubleshooting hardware issues, as they dictate how components communicate, their physical connections, and data transfer speeds, impacting overall system performance and interoperability."
