description: "Diagnostic tools and software are essential components in the troubleshooting process of PC hardware. These tools are designed to help identify, diagnose, and resolve hardware issues effectively. They can assess the functionality of various components, benchmark performance, and provide detailed reports on hardware status. Common tools include POST (Power-On Self-Test) cards, diagnostic software like CPU-Z, Speccy, and memtest86, and utilities provided by hardware manufacturers. Utilizing these tools not only speeds up the troubleshooting process but also enhances the accuracy of identifying the root cause of hardware problems, ultimately leading to efficient resolutions."
