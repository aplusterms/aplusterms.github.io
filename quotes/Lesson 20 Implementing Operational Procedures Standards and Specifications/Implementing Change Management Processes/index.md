title: "Implementing Change Management Processes"
description: "Change Management Processes involve a structured approach to managing changes in an IT environment. This includes planning, testing, and documenting changes to minimize disruption and maintain system integrity. Effective change management ensures that changes are made in a controlled manner, reducing the potential for errors and downtime. It typically includes processes such as request for change (RFC), impact analysis, approval procedures, and communication of changes to relevant stakeholders. Proper implementation of change management helps organizations adapt to evolving technology needs while maintaining operational stability."
