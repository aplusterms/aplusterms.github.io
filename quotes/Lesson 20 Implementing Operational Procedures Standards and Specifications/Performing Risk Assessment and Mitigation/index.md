title: "Performing Risk Assessment and Mitigation"
description: "Performing Risk Assessment and Mitigation involves identifying potential risks that could negatively impact an organizationâ€™s operations and developing strategies to minimize or eliminate those risks. This process includes assessing the likelihood and impact of various threats, determining vulnerabilities within systems and processes, and prioritizing risks based on their potential effect. Once risks are identified, appropriate mitigation strategies such as implementing security measures, developing contingency plans, or enhancing user training can be established. Continuous monitoring and review are also essential to adapt to new risks and ensure a resilient operational framework."
