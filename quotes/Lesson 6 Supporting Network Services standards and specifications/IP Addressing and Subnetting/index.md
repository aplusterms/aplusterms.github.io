title: "IP Addressing and Subnetting"
description: "IP Addressing and Subnetting are fundamental components of network communication that allow devices to identify and communicate with each other over a network. IP Addressing involves assigning unique numerical labels to each device connected to the network, which are used for routing information across the internet. Subnetting is the process of dividing a larger network into smaller, manageable subnetworks, improving network performance and security by limiting broadcast traffic. Understanding these concepts is crucial for network administrators to optimize network efficiency and ensure proper connectivity among devices."
