description: "Network protocols are the established rules and conventions that govern the communication between devices on a network. They define how data is transmitted, formatted, and processed, ensuring that devices can communicate effectively. Common protocols include Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP), which is the foundational suite for the Internet, and others like Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), File Transfer Protocol (FTP), and Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) for web browsing, file sharing, and email respectively. Understanding these protocols is essential for troubleshooting network issues and implementing secure and efficient networking solutions."
