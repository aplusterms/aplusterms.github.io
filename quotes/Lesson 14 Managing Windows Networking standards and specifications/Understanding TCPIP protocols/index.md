title: "Understanding TCPIP protocols"
description: "TCP/IP protocols form the backbone of data communication on the internet and local networks. This sub-topic covers the essential protocol suite that includes Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), Internet Protocol (IP), and other protocols such as User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP). Participants will learn how these protocols function together to provide reliable transmission of data, manage host addressing, and facilitate error reporting. Emphasis will be placed on understanding the role of IP addressing, subnetting, and the differences between the TCP and UDP transport layers in network communication."
