title: "Managing network shares and permissions"
description: "Managing network shares and permissions involves creating and configuring shared folders on Windows networks to allow users and groups to access files and resources. Key tasks include setting share permissions, which determine who can access the share over the network, and setting NTFS permissions, which control how users can interact with the files and folders within the share. This subtopic also covers the use of tools such as File Explorer, the Computer Management console, and command-line utilities for managing shares and permissions effectively. Understanding best practices for securing shares and maintaining appropriate access controls is essential for network administrators to protect sensitive data while enabling collaboration among users."
