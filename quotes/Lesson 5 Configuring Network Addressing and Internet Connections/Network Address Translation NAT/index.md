title: "Network Address Translation NAT"
description: "Network Address Translation (NAT) is a networking technique used to modify the network address information in the IP header of packets while they are in transit across a traffic routing device. It enables multiple devices on a private network to access the internet using a single public IP address. NAT helps conserve the number of public IP addresses an organization uses, provides a layer of security by hiding internal IP addresses from external networks, and facilitates the routing of return traffic back to the appropriate device on the private network. Different types of NAT include Static NAT, Dynamic NAT, and Port Address Translation (PAT), each serving specific purposes in managing IP address allocation and traffic routing."
