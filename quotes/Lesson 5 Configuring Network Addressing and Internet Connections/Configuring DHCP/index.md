title: "Configuring DHCP"
description: "Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is used to automate the assignment of IP addresses and other network configuration parameters. Configuring DHCP involves setting up a DHCP server that can allocate IP addresses dynamically to clients on a network. This sub-topic covers the principles of how DHCP operates, including the DHCP leasing process, the role of DHCP servers and clients, and configuration tasks such as defining scopes, options, and reservations to ensure efficient network addressing. Understanding DHCP is essential for managing network devices and ensuring seamless connectivity for end-users."
