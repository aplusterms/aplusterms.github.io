title: "Static vs Dynamic IP Addressing"
description: "Static IP addressing involves manually assigning a fixed IP address to a device on a network, ensuring that the device retains the same IP address each time it connects. This is beneficial for devices that require a permanent address, such as servers or network printers. Dynamic IP addressing, on the other hand, uses a DHCP server to automatically assign IP addresses to devices as they join the network. This allows for easier management of IP addresses, as devices can connect and disconnect without manual configuration. While static addressing offers stability, dynamic addressing provides flexibility and efficient use of IP address resources."
