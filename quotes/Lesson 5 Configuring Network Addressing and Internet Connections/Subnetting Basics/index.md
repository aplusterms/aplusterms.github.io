title: "Subnetting Basics"
description: "Subnetting Basics involves understanding how to divide a larger network into smaller, manageable segments called subnets. This process enhances network performance and security by limiting broadcast domains and organizing IP addresses efficiently. It requires knowledge of IP address classes, subnet masks, and CIDR notation to calculate subnets and determine the number of usable IP addresses within each subnet. Mastering these concepts is essential for effective network configuration and troubleshooting."
