title: "Server Operating Systems"
description: "Server operating systems are specialized systems designed to manage network resources, offer services to client devices, and provide high performance and reliability for enterprise tasks. Unlike desktop operating systems, server OSs are optimized for hardware configurations that prioritize processing power, memory, and network capabilities. These operating systems support multiple simultaneous connections from client machines, enabling them to serve applications, files, and databases efficiently. Common examples include Microsoft Windows Server, Linux distributions such as Ubuntu Server and CentOS, and Unix-based systems. Understanding the features and benefits of these operating systems is crucial for IT professionals tasked with maintaining server infrastructures."
