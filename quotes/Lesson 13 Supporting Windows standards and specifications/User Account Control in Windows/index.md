title: "User Account Control in Windows"
description: "User Account Control is a security feature in Windows that helps prevent unauthorized changes to the operating system. It does this by prompting for permission or administrator credentials when actions that could potentially affect the systemâ€™s operation are initiated. This helps to protect user accounts from malware and prevents accidental changes to system settings. UAC manages the execution of applications with different user privileges and allows users to run applications with standard user permissions while requiring elevated permissions for administrative tasks, ensuring a balance between usability and security."
