description: "User Account Control UAC is a security feature in Windows designed to prevent unauthorized changes to the operating system. It does so by prompting for permission or an administrator password before allowing changes that could affect system settings or applications. UAC settings can be adjusted to increase or decrease the level of notification received by users, allowing for a balance between security and convenience. Understanding how to configure UAC settings is critical for system administrators to ensure system security while maintaining a usable environment for users."
