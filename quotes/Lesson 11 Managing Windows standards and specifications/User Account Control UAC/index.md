title: "User Account Control UAC"
description: "User Account Control (UAC) is a security feature in Windows operating systems designed to prevent unauthorized changes to the operating system. UAC allows users to manage their access permissions and help mitigate the risks of malicious software being inadvertently installed. By prompting for permission or an administrator password before performing actions that could affect system settings, UAC helps protect against potentially harmful changes. The feature can be configured with different settings to provide a balance between security and user convenience, making it an essential component of Windows security management."
