title: "Firewall Configuration"
description: "Firewall configuration involves setting up rules and policies that control the incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. It helps protect networks from unauthorized access and cyber threats while allowing legitimate communication to occur. Properly configuring a firewall is essential for maintaining the security of both individual devices and entire networks, ensuring that sensitive data remains protected from potential intrusions. This includes configuring settings for both hardware and software firewalls, understanding different types of firewalls like stateful and stateless, and recognizing how to implement features such as NAT and port forwarding to customize security measures according to specific network needs."
