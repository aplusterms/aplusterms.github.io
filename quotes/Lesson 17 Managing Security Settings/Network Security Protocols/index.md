description: "Network security protocols are essential frameworks that ensure the protection of data transmitted over a network. These protocols establish rules and standards for secure communication and help safeguard against unauthorized access, data breaches, and cyber attacks. Common examples include SSL/TLS for secure web communications, IPsec for securing internet protocol communications, and WPA2 for secure wireless networks. Understanding these protocols is vital for managing network security settings and implementing effective cybersecurity measures."
