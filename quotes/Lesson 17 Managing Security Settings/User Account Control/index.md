title: "User Account Control"
description: "User Account Control (UAC) is a security feature in Windows operating systems that helps prevent unauthorized changes to the system. It achieves this by prompting the user for permission or an administrator password before allowing potentially harmful actions to be executed. UAC reduces the impact of malware by ensuring that applications run with standard user privileges unless explicitly elevated, thereby protecting system integrity. It allows users to manage security settings for their accounts and control notifications about changes that require elevated permissions, making it an essential component of Windows security architecture."
