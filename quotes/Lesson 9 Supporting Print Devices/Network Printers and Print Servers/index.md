title: "Network Printers and Print Servers"
description: "Network printers are devices that connect to a network, allowing multiple users to print documents without needing a direct connection to a computer. Print servers are dedicated devices or software that manage print jobs sent from various users across the network to the printer. They simplify the printing process by allowing users to send their print requests to a central server, which then queues and processes these requests efficiently. Understanding how to configure, manage, and troubleshoot network printers and print servers is crucial in maintaining effective printing services in a networked environment."
