title: "Types of Motherboards"
description: "Motherboards come in various types that cater to different needs and specifications for computer systems. The most common motherboard types include ATX, microATX, and Mini-ITX, each varying in size, expansion capabilities, and compatibility with other components. ATX motherboards are standard for full-sized desktops and offer numerous expansion slots and ports. MicroATX motherboards are a smaller alternative that still provides several expansion options while fitting in compact cases. Mini-ITX motherboards are designed for small form factor builds, focusing on space efficiency with limited expansion slots but often featuring integrated features suitable for basic tasks. Understanding these types of motherboards is essential for selecting the right motherboard for specific hardware configurations and performance needs."
