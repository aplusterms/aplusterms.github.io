title: "Establishing strong password policies"
description: "Establishing strong password policies is essential for enhancing the security of SOHO networks. This involves defining criteria for creating complex passwords, such as incorporating a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters, as well as defining minimum length requirements. The policy should also encourage users to change passwords regularly, educate them on the importance of avoiding easily guessable passwords, and implement account lockout mechanisms after a certain number of failed attempts. Additionally, promoting the use of password managers and two-factor authentication can further strengthen security measures within the network."
