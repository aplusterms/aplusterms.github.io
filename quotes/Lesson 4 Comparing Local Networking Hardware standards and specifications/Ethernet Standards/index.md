description: "Ethernet standards define the specifications and protocols for wired network communication using Ethernet technology. These standards govern aspects such as data transfer rates, cabling types, maximum segment lengths, and network topologies. Common Ethernet standards include 10BASE-T, 100BASE-TX, and 1000BASE-T, each indicating different speeds and cable requirements. Understanding these standards is crucial for implementing efficient and reliable local area networks, ensuring compatibility between devices and maximizing network performance."
