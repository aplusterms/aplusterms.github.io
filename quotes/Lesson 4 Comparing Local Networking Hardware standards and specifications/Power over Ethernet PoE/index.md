title: "Power over Ethernet PoE"
description: "Power over Ethernet PoE is a technology that allows network cables to carry electrical power along with data. This capability eliminates the need for a separate power supply for devices such as IP cameras, wireless access points, and VoIP phones. PoE is defined by various standards, including IEEE 802.3af which provides up to 15.4 watts of power, IEEE 802.3at (PoE+) which offers up to 30 watts, and IEEE 802.3bt (PoE++) which can provide up to 60 or 100 watts. This technology simplifies the installation process and reduces cable clutter, making it ideal for both home and enterprise networking environments."
