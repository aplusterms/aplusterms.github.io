title: "Network Topologies"
description: "Network topologies refer to the arrangement or layout of various elements (like computers, switches, and other devices) in a network. They play a crucial role in determining how data is transmitted within a network and can significantly affect network performance, scalability, and cost. Common types of network topologies include star, mesh, bus, ring, and tree, each with its unique characteristics and use cases. Understanding these topologies is essential for designing efficient networks and troubleshooting network issues."
