title: "Understanding Hypervisors"
description: "Hypervisors are critical components in virtualization technology that allow multiple virtual machines to run on a single physical host. They abstract the hardware and allocate resources to each virtual machine, enabling them to operate independently with their own operating systems and applications. Hypervisors can be classified into two types: Type 1, or bare-metal hypervisors, which run directly on the hardware without an underlying operating system, and Type 2, or hosted hypervisors, which run on top of an existing operating system. Understanding hypervisors is essential for managing virtual environments effectively, optimizing resource use, and enhancing system performance and scalability."
