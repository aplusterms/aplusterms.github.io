title: "Types of Virtualization"
description: "This sub-topic covers the different forms of virtualization technology used in computing today. It includes discussions on hardware virtualization, where multiple operating systems can run independently on a single physical machine through hypervisors. The sub-topic also examines OS-level virtualization, allowing multiple user instances within a single OS, as well as application virtualization, which isolates applications from the underlying operating system. Additionally, it explores storage virtualization and network virtualization, both of which abstract physical resources to increase efficiency and flexibility in cloud environments and data centers. Understanding these types helps in optimizing resource utilization and managing IT infrastructure more effectively."
