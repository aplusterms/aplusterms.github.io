title: "Service Level Agreements SLAs"
description: "Service Level Agreements are formal contracts between service providers and clients that define the expected level of service, including performance metrics, responsibilities, and quality benchmarks. SLAs outline critical components such as uptime guarantees, response times for support requests, and penalties for service degradation. These agreements are vital in cloud and virtualization environments where multiple users depend on shared resources, ensuring clarity in service expectations and accountability."
